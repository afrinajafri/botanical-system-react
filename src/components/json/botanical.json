    "description": "Ficus lyrata, commonly known as the fiddle-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the mulberry and fig family Moraceae. It is native to western Africa, from Cameroon west to Sierra Leone, where it grows in lowland tropical rainforest. It can grow up to 12â€“15 m tall.", 
    "location": "Just like with the squash, you plant the seeds in hills. For bush type pumpkins, you'll need 3 feet around each plant. For the vining type, allow as much as 8' to 10' between plants for the vining type. Vining pumpkins require a great deal of space to spread. A big pumpkin vine can grow 6inch in one day.",
    "schedule": " One week after blossoms appear, you should side dress the vines with fertilizer. Side-dressing means spreading the fertilizer close enough to the plants so that their roots can eat it up. After you see 3 or 4 fruits appear, you should then replace the row cover but not before thinning the vine with pruning shears." }
