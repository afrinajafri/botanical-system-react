    "description": "Succulents are plants with fleshy, thickened leaves and/or swollen stems that store water. The word “succulent” comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning juice or sap. Succulents are able to survive on limited water resources, such as dew and mist, making them tolerant of drought. There are many different species and cultivars of succulents spanning several plant families, and most people associate succulents with Cactaceae, the cactus family. (Keep in mind, however, that while all cacti are succulents, not all succulents are cacti.)",

    "watering": "Size matters, but generally speaking, you can water these plants every 2-3 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings. Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower light. Always be sure to research watering requirements for your specific succulent. ",
    "soil": "Succulents need soil that drains, so regular potting soil—or dirt from your yard—won't do. Choose cactus soil or mix potting soil with sand, pumice, or perlite. Succulent roots are very fragile so be gentle when repotting.",

    "light": "Bougainvillea needs at least 6 hours of full sun a day to flower profusely and look its best. This plant also loves the heat. Not enough sun = not enough color. If you live where in a climate where bougainvillea is borderline zone hardy (see zones below), then planting it against a warm wall or in a corner against the house will help. Remember, this is one plant that loves sun and heat!",

    "watering": "Your Money Tree prefers deep but infrequent watering. Water your Money Tree when the top 50%-75% of the soil is dry. Water the plant until it runs from the drainage holes and discard any excess water from the saucer. To prevent root rot, make sure your plant is never standing in water. Be sure to turn your Money Tree each time you water to allow for even growth and leaf development. Your Money Tree requires less water in the winter months when growth slows.",

    "light": "These flowers grow well in both full sun and partial shade. The best growing site offers some protection from strong afternoon sun, which can cause browning of the foliage. Balsam flowers can survive in full shade, though their blooms will likely be sparse in those conditions.",
    "watering": "Conversely, they don't tolerate drought well and will usually stop flowering if they don't get enough water. Water whenever the top inch or two of soil feels dry to the touch, but avoid overwatering and causing your plants to become waterlogged.",
    "soil": "Organically rich, well-draining soil is best for balsam flowers. A loamy soil is recommended, though they also can grow in sandy and clay soils. A slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is ideal, but they can handle slightly alkaline soil too.",
    "temperature": "32 degrees Fahrenheit or below",
    "fertilizer": "Balsam flowers benefit from a light application of dry or water-soluble fertilizer every couple of weeks throughout the growing season."},

Peace lilies that are placed in more light tend to produce the lovely white spathes and flowers more, while peace lilies in low light will bloom less and will look more like a traditional foliage plant.",
    "watering": "Peace lilies are far more tolerant of underwatering than overwatering, which is one of the most common reasons for a peace lily to die. It is because of this, you should never water peace lily plants on a schedule. Rather, you should check them once a week to see if they need to be watered. Simply touch the top of the soil to see if it is dry.",
    "soil": "Peace lilies tends to bloom better when slightly pot-bound. Repot when it’s difficult to keep the plant watered enough.",
